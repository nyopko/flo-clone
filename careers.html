                    <li class="opening-text"><strong>Career Timeline</strong></li>
                    <li class="bulleted-list"><strong>Past:</strong> After graduating from Kent State University, I spent the first few years of my career working in marketing. While most of the work was very old-school, traditional marketing in the medical field, my side hustle was in the music industry. During this time I moonlighted as the Associate Editor for a leading music publication and assisted with the marketing efforts for one of Cleveland's top entertainment companies. During this time, I started performing digital marketing duties and became exposed to code. I immediately fell in love and knew this is what I wanted to do with my life. This led me to Case Western Reserve University where I enrolled in their Full-Stack Coding Boot Camp.</li>
                    <li class="bulleted-list"><strong>Present:</strong> While learning to become a Full-Stack Web Developer, I shifted to entirely freelance work to give me more time to study. Most of my work involves marketing events, writing articles, and creating press content for artists in the music sector. Unfortunately, as the pandemic hit, my industry was decimated and I was left scrambling looking for ways to recoup the lost revenue. Fortunately, I was already searching for a job as a developer, however, juggling the need for both immediate work and a long-term opportunity during the shutdown has made the job search process difficult. With that being said, I still spend hours upon hours each week sharpening my skills and becoming a better developer each day. I am delighted with my progress so far and feel confident in my ability to meet the needs of any duties I'm tasked with.</li>
                    <li class="bulleted-list"><strong>Future:</strong> I am currently searching for a position as a Web Developer and to start my career in a new industry. While I am admittedly still new to the world of 1s and 0s, I am confident that my education and abilities can make me a valuable asset on any team. Although my previous experiences may seem unrelated to coding, they've provided me with an arsenal of skills I can apply to any role. I've picked up an intense eye for detail working as an Associate Editor, learned how to ask thoughtful questions and extract important information from a client as a writer, and even worked hand-in-hand with my previous employers' CEOs on how to directly help them reach their goals. I can't wait to learn more about how I can provide my skills to help your team thrive for years to come.</li>
                    <li class="opening-text"><strong>Future Application Updates</strong></li>
                    <li class="bulleted-list"><strong>Space Education:</strong> Although the numerous API calls work flawlessly on the React-Powered project, there are serious problems with the responsiveness of the application. Due to unfortunate circumstances surrounding group members abandoning the project I was left with many hurdles I am still working to overcome so that I can showcase the project I am so proud of.</li>
                    <li class="bulleted-list"><strong>This Page:</strong> As this was made in just a few hours, I would like to go back and clean up some of the CSS and possibly implement a different grid as I am less than satisfied with the current Materialize framework.</li>
                    <li class="bulleted-list"><strong>Music/Weather API:</strong> Even though this was one of the first projects I ever created, I think the concept is so fun and I'd really like to keep the application alive. Due to frequent client-side CORS errors, I will likely shift the project to a new API and eventually integrate the Spotify API.</li>
                    <li class="bulleted-list"><strong>My Personal Website:</strong> I plan on adding more features that will improve my accessibility and SEO scores of 84 and 90 respectively, to 100.</li>
